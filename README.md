About
This project aims to build a music recommendation system that suggests personalized music tracks to users. By analyzing user preferences and listening history, the system recommends songs from different genres, artists, and albums. The machine learning model is deployed in a user-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit.

Features
User-based Recommendations: Suggests tracks based on a user's listening history and preferences.
Content-based Recommendations: Recommends music based on attributes like genre, artist, and track features.
Hybrid Model: Combines both user-based and content-based approaches for better recommendations.
Interactive Web Interface: Streamlit app for easy interaction with the recommendation system.
Personalized Experience: Users can get tailored song recommendations directly from the web interface.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical computations
scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
matplotlib for data visualization
Streamlit for the web interface
TensorFlow/Keras (optional for deep learning models)
Dataset: (Include dataset details like source or how to generate)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-recommendation-system.git
cd music-recommendation-system
Install dependencies:
Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset:
Download the dataset from (provide the source or instructions on where to get it).
Ensure the dataset is placed in the /data folder (or modify the code to point to the location of your dataset).
Usage
Training the Model:
To train the music recommendation model, run:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Running the Streamlit App:
Once the model is trained, you can run the Streamlit web app to interact with the recommendation system. Use the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will open a web interface where users can input their preferences or listening history to get personalized song recommendations.

Making Recommendations:
The Streamlit app allows users to:

Enter their favorite genres, artists, or past tracks they've listened to.
Receive music recommendations tailored to their preferences.
