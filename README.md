## About

This project aims to build a music recommendation system that suggests personalized music tracks to users. By analyzing user preferences and listening history, the system recommends songs from different genres, artists, and albums. The machine learning model is deployed in a user-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit.

## Features
- **User-based Recommendations**: Suggests tracks based on a user's listening history and preferences.
- **Content-based Recommendations**: Recommends music based on attributes like genre, artist, and track features.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines both user-based and content-based approaches for better recommendations.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Streamlit app for easy interaction with the recommendation system.
- **Personalized Experience**: Users can get tailored song recommendations directly from the web interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms
  - `matplotlib` for data visualization
  - `Streamlit` for the web interface
  - `TensorFlow/Keras` (optional for deep learning models)
- **Dataset**: (Include dataset details like source or how to generate)
